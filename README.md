# llm-prompt-defence-gpt2
Fine-tuned GPT-2 model for detecting malicious LLM prompts such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and context manipulation. Designed to serve as a pre-processing layer for securing LLM-based applications.

This repository contains the training script, dataset samples, and inference logic for a GPT-2 that detects prompt injection and other LLM abuse patterns. Useful as a filter in agent-based systems, chat interfaces, and API frontends to reduce malicious prompt exposure.
